			The <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a>publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> and <a href="http://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but its also good for making more traditional books, such as the nbovel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and afectionaltey irreverent book report on this classic of American Literature.

		<h3>Moby-Dick: A classic tale of the sea</h3>

			<a href="https://softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank"><em>moby-dick</em></a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, andnothing particular to nterest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. it is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the curculation
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			after drigin off his spleen (which <em>cant</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for t approimately on jillion pages. The only ting bigger than Moby Dick (who-<em>spoiler alert!</em>-is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
